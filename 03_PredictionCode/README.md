Neonatal sepsis is blood infection that occurs in infant younger than 90 days old. Neonatal sepsis is one of the biggest cause of deaths in new-borns of which 83% happens in rural area.

Main objective of this project is to identify key factors which help in assessing the probability of sepsis in neonatal babies before the blood culture report is received. This will help in unnecessary administration of antibiotics in babies. Only the babies with high probability of sepsis will be administered antibiotics and hence reducing antibiotic resistance in babies and further reduce mortality due to the same.

Predicting neonatal sepsis is a challenge which leads to administration of panic antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance in babies. This project aims in using machine learning algorithms to extract the features which can help in predicting the risk of baby getting sepsis.
